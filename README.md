# README Constructor
It is essential to include a quality, thorough README in any open source project on Github.  With the README Constructor, you will be able to spend less time writing a README and more time developing your product.  All through the command line, the README constructor takes in a number of questions answered by the user, and generates a professional, easy-to-read README with all of the important bases covered.
